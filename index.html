        <b>Where am I From?</b>
            <p>Hi, I was born and raised in Chennai, India. A southern coastal metropolis in India which is known for its cultural 
            landmarks and technically advanced student population. I did my schooling, undergraudate, and masters degree in science in 
            Chennai.</p>

        <b>My first stop in the US OF A</b>
         <P>I first came to a quaint small University Township for my doctoral degree. Though snmall in szie, Oxford OH </P>
        <b>Why did I move to Saint Louis?</b>
        <p>When I finished my PhD I was looking for change in the model organism in which  I did my research. Hence
        I chose to move to pre-clinical studies from plant model system. Since such changes are generally not pursued, or not
            appreciated it was a bit hard to obtain a postdoc position.</p>
